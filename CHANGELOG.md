## [0.0.1] - 2024-12-19

### Changed
- **Font family variables moved to manual definition**: Font variables (`--font-sans`, `--font-serif`, `--font-mono`, `--font-heading`) are now manually defined in the main `@theme` block at the top of `globals.css` instead of being auto-generated
- **Font generation script updated**: `scripts/sync-figma-fonts.js` now reads existing font family variables from `@theme` and intelligently maps Figma text styles to the appropriate semantic font classes
- **Multiple font family support**: Added support for multiple font families in components with semantic classes (e.g., `font-heading` for display/title elements vs `font-sans` for body text)
- **Improved color sync preservation**: `scripts/sync-figma-colors.js` now preserves font variables in the main `@theme` block without moving or removing them

### Added
- **Semantic font class generation**: Font utilities now automatically use the correct semantic classes (`font-heading`, `font-sans`, `font-mono`) based on matching font families between Figma exports and CSS variable definitions
- **Flexible font variable support**: Script supports arbitrary user-defined font variables (e.g., `--font-action`, `--font-display`) and maps them appropriately

### Removed
- **Automatic Google Fonts import generation**: Font imports are now manually managed in `globals.css` instead of being auto-generated by the sync script
- **Hardcoded font family mapping**: Removed hardcoded "Mukta" and "Bree Serif" mappings in favor of dynamic variable detection

### Technical Details
- Font variables are positioned at the top of the main `@theme` block for proper Tailwind 4.1 utility class generation
- The sync workflow now supports manual font management while maintaining automated Figma synchronization
- Default fallback to `font-sans` when no matching font family variable is found
